	- when we measure **how “fast” an operation takes**, we do not refer to ~~how fast the operation takes in terms of pure time~~, but instead in **how many steps it takes**.

	- p23 The **Array**: The Foundational Data Structure
		- **operations**
			- **Read**: Reading refers to looking something up from a particular spot within the data structure. eg: `array[0]`, which grocery item is located at index 2 would be reading from the array.
			- **Search**: Searching refers to looking for a particular value within a data structure. eg: `???`, if "dates" is in our grocery list, and which index it’s located at would be searching the array.
			- **Insert**: Insertion refers to adding another value to our data structure. eg: `array.push("figs")`, add "figs" to our shopping list
			- **Delete**: Deletion refers to removing a value from our data structure. eg: `???`, removed "bananas" from our grocery list
