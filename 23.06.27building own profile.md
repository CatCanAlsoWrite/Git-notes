All websites begin with three basic elements: **a domain name, hosting, and a platform**.
- domain name: 
	- Your address on the web. It's the part that comes between **"http://www."** and **".com"**.
		- TIP: There's a huge selection of ahref great domain extensions besides .com. Why not get creative with something like .club, .life, or even .pizza?

	- [DNS](https://www.namecheap.com/dns/what-is-dns-domain-name-system-definition/?_ga=2.21765560.2031472230.1688010817-1451088726.1687430348&_gac=1.261421567.1687432049.Cj0KCQjw4s-kBhDqARIsAN-ipH1qy1G19bq_ZJEvV47djPktwjTTJ6N35VWHNlCToj9Pz4pORODD0pMaAj59EALw_wcB&_gl=1*1cyf0bi*_ga*MTQ1MTA4ODcyNi4xNjg3NDMwMzQ4*_ga_7DMJMG20P8*MTY4ODExMTkyNi44LjEuMTY4ODExMjI0MS42MC4wLjA.) 
		- what it is?
			- The domain name system (DNS) **connects URLs** with their **IP address**. 
			- **With DNS, it’s possible to type words** ~~instead of a string of numbers~~ **into a browser**, allowing people to **search for websites and send emails** using familiar names. 
			- When you search for a [domain name](https://www.namecheap.com/) in a browser, it **sends a query over the internet** to **match the domain with its corresponding IP**. 
			- Once located, it **uses the IP to retrieve the website’s content**.
		- how it works?
			- **Everything that connects to the internet** - websites, tablets, laptops, mobile phones, Google Home, internet thermostats, and refrigerators **has an IP address**. 
			- An **internet protocol address by its full name** is a **unique string of numbers that identifies each digital device** to **communicate via the world wide web**.
			- Thanks to DNS, there is no need to maintain an address book of IP addresses. Every time you use a domain name, the **DNS service locates the website** and **translates the name into its corresponding IP address**. 
			- Alphabetic domain names are easier to remember than IP address numbers, so when you type [www.google.com](http://www.google.com/) into a web browser, you only have to remember the URL.
			- eg:
				- As soon as you **type a domain name**, for example, _Amazon.com_ into your browser, **your browser, and computer check** if one of them **has the domains related IP address in their memory**.
				- ***If*** _Amazon.com_ ***isn’t in your computer's local memory (cached memory)***, it expands the search out to the **internet** where it **queries the DNS** to determine if the **domain exists in their DNS database**. ***If the first DNS doesn’t find it on its server***, it **sends it to the next server until** the right domain name server is found. For example, the URL for Amazon.com is associated with servers run by Amazon Web Services. The domain name system allows you to reach Amazon’s servers when you type _Amazon.com_ into your web browser.
				- ***Once the DNS server finds the domain name*** _Amazon.com_, the **server returns the domain name, and it’s IPS address** to **the requesting DNS server**, **along down the line until** it arrives back at your computer.
				- ***Once the IP address has reached your computer***, **your browser finds it on the internet**. Next up, **it communicate with the domain name** hosted to request any associated files. The host server returns the files which display _Amazon.com_ in your web browser.
		- how domain name relate to IP addresses? how the hierarchy is queried by your computer?
			- To understand how the hierarchy is queried by your computer to produce a website on your screen, you need a basic understanding of the elements that comprise a domain name and how these relate to IP addresses.
			- **Third-Level Domain** - Also known as the **subdomain**. Simply put, a subdomain is anything that appears before the second level domain, the most common subdomain is **www.** But they can take many forms, such as _books.google.com_.	    
			- **Second-Level Domain** - This is the often the name of the website and the unique part of the domain name, appearing to the immediate left of the TLD. For example, the second-level domain in the URL [www.namecheap.com](https://www.namecheap.com/) is _Namecheap_ sandwiched between the third and top-level domain.		    
			- **Top-Level Domain** - Is the furthest point to the right of the domain. The most common TLD is **.com**. Within the hierarchy, TLDs are at the top with regard to domain names. ICANN oversees TLDs and facilitates the distribution of TLDs, most commonly through a domain registrar such as Namecheap.		    
			- **IP Address** - An Internet Protocol address is an addressable location on the internet. Each IP is unique with its network. In relation to websites, the network is the entire internet. The **most common form of IP addresses** are known as is **IPv4**, and **written as a set of four numbers**; each set has ~~no more than three digits~~ **between 0 and 255**, and each set is separated by a single dot. **157.158.458.756**, for example, would be an ~~invalid IPv4 address~~. The DNS maps a name to that address saving you the bother of remembering a complicated series of numbers for each website you want to visit.
		- how does the DNS translate domain name to IP addresses? 
			- The process is called DNS resolution and plays out over eight steps.
- hosting
	- Where all the data and information about your site is kept. If the domain is your street address, hosting is your house.
