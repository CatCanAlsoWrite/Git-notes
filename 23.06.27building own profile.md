All websites begin with three basic elements: **a domain name, hosting, and a platform**.
- domain name: 
	- Your address on the web. It's the part that comes between **"http://www."** and **".com"**.
		- TIP: There's a huge selection of ahref great domain extensions besides .com. Why not get creative with something like .club, .life, or even .pizza?

	- DNS 
		- what it is?
			- The domain name system (DNS) **connects URLs** with their **IP address**. 
			- **With DNS, it’s possible to type words** ~~instead of a string of numbers~~ **into a browser**, allowing people to **search for websites and send emails** using familiar names. 
			- When you search for a [domain name](https://www.namecheap.com/) in a browser, it **sends a query over the internet** to **match the domain with its corresponding IP**. 
			- Once located, it **uses the IP to retrieve the website’s content**.
		- how it works?
			- **Everything that connects to the internet** - websites, tablets, laptops, mobile phones, Google Home, internet thermostats, and refrigerators **has an IP address**. 
			- An **internet protocol address by its full name** is a **unique string of numbers that identifies each digital device** to **communicate via the world wide web**.
			- Thanks to DNS, there is no need to maintain an address book of IP addresses. Every time you use a domain name, the **DNS service locates the website** and **translates the name into its corresponding IP address**. 
			- Alphabetic domain names are easier to remember than IP address numbers, so when you type [www.google.com](http://www.google.com/) into a web browser, you only have to remember the URL.
			- eg:
				- As soon as you **type a domain name**, for example, _Amazon.com_ into your browser, **your browser, and computer check** if one of them **has the domains related IP address in their memory**.
				- ***If*** _Amazon.com_ ***isn’t in your computer's local memory (cached memory)***, it expands the search out to the **internet** where it **queries the DNS** to determine if the **domain exists in their DNS database**. ***If the first DNS doesn’t find it on its server***, it **sends it to the next server until** the right domain name server is found. For example, the URL for Amazon.com is associated with servers run by Amazon Web Services. The domain name system allows you to reach Amazon’s servers when you type _Amazon.com_ into your web browser.
- hosting
	- Where all the data and information about your site is kept. If the domain is your street address, hosting is your house.

- platform/coding
	- The tools with which you make your website and the space in which it's created.
