Learnt React and JSX using VScode, and solved some problems:  

8. 
𝙨𝙤𝙡𝙪𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣:  
◎ Open the package.json and type `ctrl + s` and it disappears.
𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙨𝙤𝙣:  
◎ https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/issues/4186
𝙚𝙧𝙧𝙤𝙧 in terminal after "npm start" command:  
```javascript
ERROR in [eslint] Plugin "react" was conflicted between "package.json » eslint-config-react-app » C:\Users\hellowlee\Desktop\js\jobify\client\node_modules\eslint-config-react-app\base.js" and "BaseConfig » C:\Users\hellowlee\Desktop\js\JOBIFY\client\node_modules\eslint-config-react-app\base.js". 
```

7. 
𝙨𝙤𝙡𝙪𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣:  
◎ disable extension 'VIM'
𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙨𝙤𝙣:  
◎ extension 'VIM' allows editing only in command line??
  
𝙚𝙧𝙧𝙤𝙧 when opened VSCode
can't edit

---
6. 
𝙨𝙤𝙡𝙪𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣:  
◎ just ignore the error!!
 ~~change both 'onAfterSetupMiddleware' and 'onBeforeSetupMiddleware' to 'setupMiddlewares' in file 'webpackDevServer.config.js' in 'src\node_modules\react-scripts\config\webpack'~~ 
𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙨𝙤𝙣:  
◎ actually no need to solve that (actually, solving the problem will even lead to 'localhost refused to connect', can't preview the code, the "React Developer Tools" extension in chrome is inactive )
~~webpack syntax needs update manually~~

𝙖𝙩𝙩𝙚𝙣𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣: 
◎ any change in deep settings of VSCode will execute only when restart. If something wrong, try to remember what I have done before 'restarted'.
   
𝙚𝙧𝙧𝙤𝙧 in terminal after "npm start" command:  
```javascript
(node:10340) [DEP_WEBPACK_DEV_SERVER_ON_AFTER_SETUP_MIDDLEWARE] DeprecationWarning: 'onAfterSetupMiddleware' option is deprecated. Please use the 'setupMiddlewares' option.
(Use `node --trace-deprecation ...` to show where the warning was created)
(node:10340) [DEP_WEBPACK_DEV_SERVER_ON_BEFORE_SETUP_MIDDLEWARE] DeprecationWarning: 'onBeforeSetupMiddleware' option is deprecated. Please use the 
'setupMiddlewares' 
ow view client in the 
browser.
```

5.  
𝙨𝙤𝙡𝙪𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣:  
◎ install "React Developer Tools" extension in chrome
𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙨𝙤𝙣:  
◎ unfamiliar with preview tools
  
𝙚𝙧𝙧𝙤𝙧 in terminal after "npm start" command:  
can't preview the code

---  
4.  
𝙨𝙤𝙡𝙪𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣:  
◎ ignore the error  
𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙨𝙤𝙣:  
◎ the extension "Code Runner" don't support JSX syntax  
  
𝙚𝙧𝙧𝙤𝙧 in terminal after "npm start" command:  
```javascript
<div>  
^  
SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'
```

---  
3.  
𝙨𝙤𝙡𝙪𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣:  
◎ try "npm start" command again till succeed  
𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙨𝙤𝙣:  
◎ actually not my fault, so ignore the error and try once more  
  
𝙚𝙧𝙧𝙤𝙧 in terminal after "npm start" command:  
```javascript
npm ERR! Failed at the filename@0.1.0 start script.  
npm ERR! This is probably not a problem with npm. There is likely additional logging output above.
```

---  
2.  
𝙨𝙤𝙡𝙪𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣:  
◎ add *"type": "module",* property into "package.json" file  
𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙨𝙤𝙣:  
◎ Node.js don't know the meaning of "import"/"export", unless been taught through "package.json" file  
  
𝙚𝙧𝙧𝙤𝙧 in terminal after "npm start" command:  
```javascript
import Btn from './Btn';  
^^^^^^  
SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module  
```

---
1.  
𝙨𝙤𝙡𝙪𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣:  
◎ add the missing step --"cd *filename*" command  
𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙨𝙤𝙣:  
◎ missed one step between "npm init react-app *filename*" and "npm start" command  
  
𝙚𝙧𝙧𝙤𝙧 in terminal after "npm start" command:  
```javascript
npm ERR! code ENOENT  
npm ERR! syscall open  
npm ERR! path C:\Users\.../package.json  
npm ERR! errno -4058  
npm ERR! enoent ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'C:\Users\...\package.json'  
npm ERR! enoent This is related to npm not being able to find a file.  
...
```
