Learnt React and JSX using VScode, and solved some problems:  



14. 
**solution**
use 'git bash' instead

**problem**
`openssl` is a git command

**error**
after `openssl rand -base64 32` in 'powershell'
```javascript
openssl : 无法将“openssl”项识别为 cmdlet、函数、脚本文件或可运行程序的名称。请检查名称的拼写，如果包括路径，请确保
路径正确，然后再试一次。
所在位置 行:1 字符: 1
+ openssl rand -base64 32
+ ~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (openssl:String) [], CommandNotFoundException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : CommandNotFoundException
```

13. 
**solution**
- don't need to create extra `.babelrc` file
- In NextJS Project `.eslintrc.json` file, replace code `{ "extends": "next/core-web-vitals" }` with `{ "extends": ["next/babel","next/core-web-vitals"] }`

**problem**

**error**
eslint warning error on `export` keywords:
```javascript
Parsing error: Cannot find module 'next/babel'  
Require stack:  
- D:\Desktop\KTN\duronn-frontend\node_modules\next\dist\compiled\babel\bundle.js  
- D:\Desktop\KTN\duronn-frontend\node_modules\next\dist\compiled\babel\eslint-parser.js  
- D:\Desktop\KTN\duronn-frontend\node_modules\eslint-config-next\parser.js  
- D:\Desktop\KTN\duronn-frontend\node_modules\@eslint\eslintrc\dist\eslintrc.cjs  
  
Make sure that all the Babel plugins and presets you are using  
are defined as dependencies or devDependencies in your package.json  
file. It's possible that the missing plugin is loaded by a preset  
you are using that forgot to add the plugin to its dependencies: you  
can workaround this problem by explicitly adding the missing package  
to your top-level package.json.
eslint
```

12. 
**solution**
`{...register("xxx", { valueAsNumber: true })}`

**problem**
input `type=number` is not enough, need a `{ valueAsNumber: true }` in `zod`

**error**
`isValid` in `zod` is not working

11. 
[**solution**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52586965/why-does-prettier-not-format-code-in-vs-code)  
- in VSCode, choose 'File'→'Preferences'→'Settings'→'Search for `default formatter`'
- Make sure: 
	- `Editor: Default Formatter` field is not `null` but rather `Prettier - Code formatter (esbenp.prettier-vscode)` 
	- all the languages below are ticked. This fixed my issue.![Steps to enable default formatter](https://i.stack.imgur.com/DINkP.png)
	- format on save is enabled:![Format on save check](https://i.stack.imgur.com/xBmiH.png)

**problem**
setting problem after newly installed the plugin 'Prettier'

**error**
prettier not working on vscode

10. 
[**solution**](https://forum.gitlab.com/t/the-authenticity-of-host-gitlab-com-54-93-71-23-cant-be-established/916/15) 
???

**problem**
???

**error**
`git clone xxx-SSH-link`
```javascript

𝙨𝙤𝙡𝙪𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣:  
◎ add `<div></div>` after `return` in 'Alert' component to contain all codes
𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙨𝙤𝙣:  
◎ It has to do with using react fragments. The root component of the main route was the App component. However, in the App component I had a fragment with two components inside. When navigating, it attempted to remove the App component which did not actually exist since it was a fragment which does not add to the actual dom.
𝙚𝙧𝙧𝙤𝙧 in console of chrome after adding function `{alertVisible && ( <Alert onClose={() => tAlertVisibility(false)}>myAlert</Alert> )}`:
```JavaScript
Uncaught DOMException: Failed to execute 'removeChild' on 'Node': The node to be removed is not a child of this node.

The above error occurred in the <Alert> component:
Consider adding an error boundary to your tree to customize error handling behavior.

𝙨𝙤𝙡𝙪𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣:  
◎ Open the package.json and type `ctrl + s` and it disappears.

𝙚𝙧𝙧𝙤𝙧 in terminal after "npm start" command:  
```javascript
ERROR in [eslint] Plugin "react" was conflicted between "package.json » eslint-config-react-app » C:\Users\hellowlee\Desktop\js\jobify\client\node_modules\eslint-config-react-app\base.js" and "BaseConfig » C:\Users\hellowlee\Desktop\js\JOBIFY\client\node_modules\eslint-config-react-app\base.js".

𝙨𝙤𝙡𝙪𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣:  
◎ disable extension 'VIM'
𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙨𝙤𝙣:  
◎ extension 'VIM' allows editing only in command line??
  
𝙚𝙧𝙧𝙤𝙧 when opened VSCode
can't edit

---
6. 
𝙨𝙤𝙡𝙪𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣:  
◎ just ignore the error!!
 ~~change both 'onAfterSetupMiddleware' and 'onBeforeSetupMiddleware' to 'setupMiddlewares' in file 'webpackDevServer.config.js' in 'src\node_modules\react-scripts\config\webpack'~~ 
𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙨𝙤𝙣:  
◎ actually no need to solve that (actually, solving the problem will even lead to 'localhost refused to connect', can't preview the code, the "React Developer Tools" extension in chrome is inactive )
~~webpack syntax needs update manually~~

𝙖𝙩𝙩𝙚𝙣𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣: 
◎ any change in deep settings of VSCode will execute only when restart. If something wrong, try to remember what I have done before 'restarted'.
   
𝙚𝙧𝙧𝙤𝙧 in terminal after "npm start" command:  
```javascript
(node:10340) [DEP_WEBPACK_DEV_SERVER_ON_AFTER_SETUP_MIDDLEWARE] DeprecationWarning: 'onAfterSetupMiddleware' option is deprecated. Please use the 'setupMiddlewares' option.
(Use `node --trace-deprecation ...` to show where the warning was created)
(node:10340) [DEP_WEBPACK_DEV_SERVER_ON_BEFORE_SETUP_MIDDLEWARE] DeprecationWarning: 'onBeforeSetupMiddleware' option is deprecated. Please use the 
'setupMiddlewares' 
ow view client in the 
browser.
```

5.  
𝙨𝙤𝙡𝙪𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣:  
◎ install "React Developer Tools" extension in chrome
𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙨𝙤𝙣:  
◎ unfamiliar with preview tools
  
𝙚𝙧𝙧𝙤𝙧 in terminal after "npm start" command:  
can't preview the code

4.  
𝙨𝙤𝙡𝙪𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣:  
◎ ignore the error  
𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙨𝙤𝙣:  
◎ the extension "Code Runner" don't support JSX syntax  
  
𝙚𝙧𝙧𝙤𝙧 in terminal after "npm start" command:  
```javascript
<div>  
^  
SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'
```

---  
3.  
𝙨𝙤𝙡𝙪𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣:  
◎ try "npm start" command again till succeed  
𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙨𝙤𝙣:  
◎ actually not my fault, so ignore the error and try once more  
  
𝙚𝙧𝙧𝙤𝙧 in terminal after "npm start" command:  
```javascript
npm ERR! Failed at the filename@0.1.0 start script.  
npm ERR! This is probably not a problem with npm. There is likely additional logging output above.
```

---  
2.  
𝙨𝙤𝙡𝙪𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣:  
◎ add *"type": "module",* property into "package.json" file  
𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙨𝙤𝙣:  
◎ Node.js don't know the meaning of "import"/"export", unless been taught through "package.json" file  
  
𝙚𝙧𝙧𝙤𝙧 in terminal after "npm start" command:  
```javascript
import Btn from './Btn';  
^^^^^^  
SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module  
```

1.  
𝙨𝙤𝙡𝙪𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣:  
◎ add the missing step --"cd *filename*" command  
𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙨𝙤𝙣:  
◎ missed one step between "npm init react-app *filename*" and "npm start" command  
  
𝙚𝙧𝙧𝙤𝙧 in terminal after "npm start" command:
