- tell me the difference about mvvm and mvc pattern, suppose I am a 10 years old girl
```html
Imagine you want to bake cookies with your mom.

In MVC:
Your mom is the <controller>. She decides what needs to be done and tells you what to do.
You are the <model>. You do the actual work of mixing ingredients, baking cookies, etc.
The oven is the <view>. It shows the cookies baking and lets you see the progress.

In MVVM:
Your mom is the <view model>. She decides what needs to be done but doesn't tell you directly.
She writes down recipes and instructions on paper for you to follow. The paper is the <model> - it has all the necessary info.
You follow the recipe like a robot and do exactly what it says. You don't think for yourself.
The oven is still the <view>. It shows the result of your cookie baking efforts.

So in summary:
In MVC, the controller <directly tells the model> what to do.
In MVVM, the view model <indirectly tells the model> what to do <through something like a recipe or set of instructions>. The model doesn't think for itself in MVVM, it just follows instructions passively.
```

- the model in mvvm save info and do actual work, while the model in mvc only do actual work but don't save info. right?
```html
Good observation! The responsibilities of the 'model' do differ slightly between MVC and MVVM:

MVC model:
Just <business logic and data>
No loading or saving data

MVVM model:
<Business logic and data>
Also responsible for <loading and saving data>

The reason for this difference is because MVVM introduces an abstraction between the view and model via the view model. So the model takes on data persistence duties since the view model doesn't do it.

In both patterns, the model represents the business domain and data. But only in MVVM does it handle loading and saving that data as well.
```

- what do you mean by 'loading data'? explain as if I am a 10 years old girl
```html
Imagine you have a sticker album to collect stickers of cute puppies. Each puppy sticker has a name, breed, age, etc.

In MVC, your sticker album just has empty spaces for stickers. To fill it, <someone has to physically give you new stickers> to put in the empty slots.
In MVVM, your sticker album <knows how to load stickers all by itself!> It can:
Call the sticker store on the phone and place an order for more stickers
Open a pack of stickers your mom bought and put them in the right spots
Take stickers out of your locker at school and add them to the album

So the MVVM sticker album doesn't just hold stickers, it knows how to get new stickers from different places and add them to the right pages.

The MVC sticker album just stores the stickers - someone else has to get new stickers and put them on the pages.

So in software, "loading data" is like the album ordering stickers or taking them from your locker. It gets new data from storage and puts it into the model objects.
