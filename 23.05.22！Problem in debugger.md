◎ 1.open the file I want to debug (if a html file with js script, choose the html file  to deal with) →click 'Go Live' button in the bottom of VSCode, the debug website will open automatically →right click mouse, choose 'inspect', choose 'source'(at this time, debugger is inactive) 
◎ 2.open 'debug' in VSCode →add new file/change file 'launch.json' with 'type: chrome', =='url' port='Go Live' port== →save file →go back to localhost page(at this time, debugger is active)

◎ should use 'live server' extension in VSCode to help locating to the right website, should find out the right 'port' 
  
𝙚𝙧𝙧𝙤𝙧 when use VSCode debug function, localhost 'refused to connect'
