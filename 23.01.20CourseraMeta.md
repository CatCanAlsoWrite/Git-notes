					- →git [add](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-version-control/lecture/UADXz/add-and-commit) (to staging area): git add ./git add xxxx.txt
						- git unstage: git restore --staged xxxx.txt
					- →git commit (to committed files): git commit -m *(message)* "xxxxx"
					- →git [push](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-version-control/lecture/N4dUy/push-and-pull)  (to remote repository): ==git push -u(upstream for the first time) origin(shorthand alias for the URL of remote repository used after git clone) xxxx(branch name)/git push origin xxxx
						- git pull(pull the latest changes from the server)
							- git [remote](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-version-control/lecture/JtPEE/remote-vs-local) ==(when collaborating, pull before push?): git remote/git remote -v(verbose, more details), git remote remove origin(if a "Recv failure: Connection was reset" error), git remote add origin https:xxxx(paste https/ssh URL from github.com)
						- resolve conflict: git log --merge *(see what branches made the merge issue)*, git [diff](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-version-control/supplement/R2ZBG/resolving-conflicts) head xxxx.txt *(find the difference caused to conflict)*; git [blame](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-version-control/lecture/Vkwae/blame) *(see where is the change)* xxxx.txt /git blame -L n,n+10 *(line range of codes)* xxxx.txt, git log *(see changes in detail)* -p xxxxxx *(hash dash ID get from git blame)*
						- *mistake solving*: I firstly entered "git push -u origin main", and cannot find meta branch in the remote repository. To fix that, I used "git checkout -B meta" to reset the branch and then "git push -u origin meta".
						- ==*mistake*: pushed to origin+URL and main+URL, git remote got both origin and main......
				- remote repository —git fetch→ committed files, 
				- remote repository —git checkout→ working directory
			- another workflow(forking)
				- fork from the original github to my github →do the branching things →submit a pull request

- [course 5](https://www.coursera.org/learn/react-basics?specialization=meta-front-end-developer) 11√+7√+7√+3√h
	- week 1
		- before learning React, be familiar with:
			- html: layout and style(<html/head/body/div>), text formatting and lists(<h1/p/ul/li/b/i>), images and links(<img src=""/a href="">), linking and meta(<link/title/meta>), semantic(<header)
			- CSS: font styling(font size, font color...), flex box layout, selectors, position padding margins and display, colors background and icons
			- JS: data types, var/let/const, conditionals and loops, objects/arrays/functions, ES6 arrow functions, in-built functions(map()/forEach()) and promises, destructuring arrays/objects, error handling
			- [package manager](https://www.coursera.org/learn/react-basics/lecture/iIQHY/creating-react-components) (Node+npm): installation command to install npm modules in project, installing a package as a dev dependency, start command, updating npm version, navigating around the package.json file
				- run the create-react-app [npm package](https://www.coursera.org/learn/react-basics/supplement/QjCEc/setting-up-a-react-project-in-vs-code-optional)  (without installing it!): input [npm init react-app firstapp *(name of the project)*] in terminal→ [cd firstapp]
				- start coding: input [npm start] in terminal→ find "src" folder
					- → find "App.js"→ delete content in "function App(){}"→ input a function [function Firstfunc(){...}] , render it to the root components(return in [function App(){ return <Firstfunc />; };] )→ export
					- → create a "component" folder→ create a "Firstfunc.js" file→ input a function [function Firstfunc(){...};]→ export
					- *mistake*: npm ERR!→ try once more
			- [JS modules](https://www.coursera.org/learn/react-basics/supplement/KGYDt/javascript-modules-imports-exports) (series of components): 
				- export
					- default: [export default Firstfunc;] || [export default function Firstfunc(){...};]
					- named: [export {Firstfunc}] || [export function Firstfunc(){...};]
				- import: [import Firstfunc from './Firstfunc.js']
					- *mistake*: cannot "import"→ add ["type": "module",] in package.json
		- SPA/single-page application(later)
		- React basics 
			- virtual DOM(clone of real DOM. React update the browser DOM only when needed) (later)
			- components(consists of well-defined, reusable, independent functionality. all component names in React must be capitalized, to distinguish JSX elements from HTML elements)
				- root component(React app must contain at least one component. "App.js" is created as default)
				- others
					- [functional](https://www.coursera.org/learn/react-basics/lecture/gQa3l/introduction-to-functional-components) 
						- JSX/JS XML(a necessary, HTML like syntax for React to script. placed inside the "return" statement of a functional component.)
						- [transpiling](https://www.coursera.org/learn/react-basics/supplement/tXKiN/dissecting-props) (a process of converting JSX to HTML)
						- create function
							- [function Firstfunc(){...};] (function declaration)
							- [const Firstfunc= function(){...};] (function expression)
							- [const Firstfunc= () =>{...};] ([arrow function](https://www.coursera.org/learn/react-basics/supplement/3Q3LY/jsx-syntax-and-the-arrow-function) )
								- [const Firstfunc= props =>{...};] (no "()" if using single parameter)
								- [const Firstfunc= () =>...;] (no "{}" if entire component is a single line of code)	
						- *mistake*: Unexpected token '<'→ ignore that
						- ![[functionalComponent 1.png]]  
							- use PascalCase||UpperCamelCase name(uppercase the first letter of a component name)
							- use "className" (replace HTML "class"); use "[style={{...}}](https://www.coursera.org/learn/react-basics/supplement/ouAVE/styling-jsx-elements) " (==difference between HTML-inline-CSS/CSS/JS-inline-CSS/JSX?==)
							- no "()" if entire return content is a single line of code
							- use "<></>"/"<h1></h1>"/... to wrap HTML code
							- use "{}"(area to write JS code) to indicate variables
						- ![[props.png]]  
							- use "props"(properties, to receive data from parent components. cannot modify data, pass data backwards) as parameter

		- data
			- category
				- props(data outside the components that it receives and works with, cannot mutate)
					- stateless component(doesn't store states, any changes must be inherited through props)
				- state(data inside the components that it controls, can mutate)
					- stateful component(holds states as internal data and its state changes based on the way that the app is built; often as a result of user actions )
			- data-flow: from parent to child component, send state/values/functions ![[flow.png]] 
				- parent![[parent.png]]  
					- import PromoHeading(child, format) from './PromoHeading.js', then put into data 
				- child![[child.png]] 
			- path data from a non-parent component
				- simple method: context API(send data from one component directly to another component) 
					- [const MyContext *(component)* = React.createContext(defaultValue *(initial value)*);]
					- context provider(component that stores the state)
						- [return (<MyContext.Provider value={...}>...</MyContext.Provider>);]
					- context consumer(component that will use the state)
						- [<MyContext.Consumer> {value =>...}</MyContext.Consumer>]
					- 
				- complex method: lifting state up(cut the state from the child component and move it to the parent component's code. a previously stateless parent component becomes a stateful component, and a previously stateful child component becomes a stateless component, ==but also parent controls child?==)+prop drilling(send data from parent to sibling component until where it is needed)
		- ==hook(used to reduce unnecessary codes)
			- rules
				- can only call hooks at the top level of your component or your own hooks.     
				- cannot call hooks inside loops or conditions.     
				- can only call hooks from React functions, and not regular JavaScript functions.
			- category
				- useState (parameter.target.value)
					- [importReact, {useState} from 'react';] || [import {useState} from 'react';] || use React. in the next step [const [state, setState]=React.useState(initialState);]

		- web pages
			- traditional(each web page needs to be loaded as the user navigates around the site)![[Pasted image 20230202203305.png]] 
			- React-powered(use [SPA/single-page application](https://www.coursera.org/learn/react-basics/supplement/6AGCZ/navigation) , allows user to interact with the website without downloading entire new webpages. Instead, it rewrites the current webpage as the user interacts with it): The web browser sends the request to the web server, and the web server sends back a JSON object. The web browser then updates the web page by inserting the template with the variables replaced by the values in the JSON object.
				- bundling(load all necessary HTML, CSS and JavaScript immediately)
				- lazy loading/code splitting(only the minimum HTML, CSS and JavaScript needed to load the application)![[Pasted image 20230202203315.png]] 
					- React Router(a library, gives you more control over the routing of components. used to replace <[a>]element, because the default behavior of an anchor tag is to load another HTML file from a server and refresh the page, it's not the way SPA works)
						- install: [npm i react-router-dom@6]
						- in index.js: [import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';], [ <BrowserRouter><App /></BrowserRouter>] (change root.render content)
						- in App.js: [import { Routes,Route } from 'react-router-dom';] ![[nav.png]]

					- or [<img src={require('./cat.jpg')}/>]
					- or [const imgUrl="https://..."] , [<img src={imgUrl} /> ] 
				- videos and audios:
					- use video element: [<video url={...}  controls/> ] 
					- use embedded third-party videos(copy the code from a third-party "share" button rendering)
					- use third-party NPM package(to streamline the process of adding videos to your app. can type "React video" in the search bar of the "npmjs.org" website to find some of the frequently downloaded NPM packages, eg: "[react-player package](https://www.coursera.org/learn/react-basics/supplement/VEaB0/media-packages) "): [npm install react-player] *(in terminal)* ![[video.png]] 
				- stylesheets
				- fonts
				- ...
			- [bundling](https://www.coursera.org/learn/react-basics/supplement/Ud3SI/bundling-assets) (can use webpack (built-in tool in React) to embed assets )
				- production mode(optimizes bundles for speed, so bundles are fast to download when a user visits the website online)
					- client-side rendering(the visitor downloads the index.html file and then lets React inject its own code into a dedicated HTML element)
					- SSR/server-side rendering(react components are rendered to HTML on the server, and the visitor downloads the finished HTML code)
				- development mode(optimizes bundles for updates, so any updates to any of the files in your locally developed app are quickly re-bundled)
