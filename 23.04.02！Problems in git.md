#CS/05git 

9. 
**solution**
` git commit --amend`, fix and close the file

**problem**
fix git commit message

8. https://www.w3schools.com/git/git_branch_pull_from_remote.asp?remote=github
**solution**
- method 1
	- `git pull`→`git checkout xxx (new-remote-branch-name)`→`npm i`, `npm run dev`
- method 2
	- `git branch -a` to see branches locally and remotely
	- →`git checkout xxx (new-remote-branch-name)` to switch to a new-local-branch 
	- →`git checkout` to ensure this new-local-branch up to date with new-remote-branch
	- →`git pull xxx`
		- if `fatal: refusing to pull unrelated histories`:
			- `git pull xxx --allow-unrelated-histories` to merge content into old-local-branch 
	- →`git checkout xx (old-local-branch-name)` to switch to old-local-branch 
	- →`git merge xxx (new-remote-branch-name)`
		- if `fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories`:
			- `git merge xxx --allow-unrelated-histories` to merge content into old-local-branch 
		- if `Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.`
			- merge manually, then `git add`+`git commit`+`git push`
	- →`git branch -D xxx` to delete new-local-branch 
	- →`npm i`, `npm run dev`

**problem**
merge new-remote-branch to old-local-branch 

7. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39963695/how-to-remove-git-hooks , https://ma.ttias.be/git-commit-without-pre-commit-hook/
**solution**
- delete file 'pre-commit hook' in folder 'hook' in folder '.git'
- →`git commit -m 'xxx' --no-verify`

**problem**
'pre-commit hook' is working

**error**
after `git commit -m 'xxx'`
```
uncaughtException [Error: EPERM: operation not permitted, open 'D:\Desktop\KTN\duronn-admin-dashboard\.next\trace'] {

claude AI:
Here are a few ways to cancel or skip the default pre-commit builds in Next.js:

**Using ENV variable:**

Set the `NEXT_TRANSPILE_ONLY` environment variable to skip building and transpile only:

Copy

```
NEXT_TRANSPILE_ONLY=1 git commit
```

**Using a git commit message:**

Prefix commit message with `[skip build]` to skip build:

Copy

```
git commit -m "[skip build] Commit message"
```

**Overriding build script:**

Replace `next build` in scripts.build with a no-op:

json

Copy

```
"scripts": {
  "build": "true" 
}
```

**Bypass Git hooks:**

Use `--no-verify` flag with commit to bypass commit hooks:

Copy

```
git commit -m "Message" --no-verify
```

**Disable Git hooks:**

Delete or modify `pre-commit` file in `.git/hooks` directory.

**Modify commit-msg hook:**

Check for `[skip build]` in commit message inside commit-msg hook.

So in summary, you can bypass the default build by leveraging environment variables, commit messages, script overrides or disabling Git hooks.

Choose the approach that best suits your workflow and needs.

6. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70241379/creating-an-optimized-build-freezes-and-never-completes
**solution**
end the terminal, and `git commit -m 'xxx'` again

**problem**
a local server running in another terminal

**error**
after `git commit -m 'xxx'`
```
Creating an optimized production build ...
```

5. 
**solution**
`git pull origin xxx-branch-name --allow-unrelated-histories`

**problem**
"git merge" used to allow merging two branches that have no common base by default, which led to a brand new history of an existing project created and then get pulled by an unsuspecting maintainer, which allowed an unnecessary parallel history merged into the existing project. The command has been taught not to allow this by default, with an escape hatch --allow-unrelated-histories option to be used in a rare event that merges histories of two projects that started their lives independently.

**error**
after `git pull origin xxx-branch-name`
```javascript
remote: Enumerating objects: 3, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (3/3), done.
remote: Total 2 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0

 * [new branch]      xxx-branch-name        -> origin/xxx-branch-name
fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories
```

4. 
**solution**
no need to do anything

**problem**
it shouldn't even be a warning in the first place. Because all this warning is saying (but backwards unfortunately) is that the CRLF characters in your file with Windows line endings will be replaced with LF's on commit. Which means it's normalized to the same line endings used by *nix and MacOS.

Nothing strange is going on, this is exactly the behavior you would normally want.

This warning in it's current form is one of two things:

An unfortunate bug combined with an over-cautious warning message, or
A very clever plot to make you really think this through...

**error**
after `git add .`
```javascript
warning: in the working copy of 'src/app/shared/floating-cart.tsx', LF will be replaced by CRLF the next time Git touches it
```

3. 
**solution**
- delete file in git repo 
	- or in local
		- !!! don't use `git clean -f(force) -d(directory)`. it will delete all local files permanently
- git `git checkout template` again

**problem**
git repo has file with the same name of local file

**error**
after `git checkout template`
```javascript
error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:
        README.md
Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
Aborting
```

2. 
**solution**
add default branch as a project owner first

**problem**
before pushing, need a default branch of git repo first

**error**
after `git push`:
```javascript
! [remote rejected] template -> template (pre-receive hook declined) error: failed to push some refs to 'gitlab.com:korsgy-technologies/duronn-infomation-technology/duronn-project/duronn-admin-dashboard.git'
```
![[img_v3_0262_2fd80d50-d2ed-46f7-a2de-6a4cda69c61g.jpg]]

1. 
**solution**
first time pushing to git: 
- `git pull origin` to update changes
- `git branch Lee`+`git checkout Lee`
- `git add .`+`git commit -m 'xxx'`+`git push --set-upstream origin Lee`

**problem**
shouldn't do that! 

**error**
can't push code to gitlab branch 'main'
```javascript
remote: GitLab: You are not allowed to push code to protected branches on this project.
To https://gitlab.com/korsgy-technologies/duronn-infomation-technology/duronn-project/duronn-frontend.git
 ! [remote rejected] main -> main (pre-receive hook declined)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://gitlab.com/korsgy-technologies/duronn-infomation-technology/duronn-project/duronn-frontend.git'
```

==upload frontend and backend code in 2 dependent repositories!!==
- in ".gitignore" of the code folder, add `/xx-frontend-folder` to avoid uploading again the frontend code

==may use github.dev to change files directly on web

# connect to git via [SSH](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-version-control/supplement/qZwXl/connecting-to-github-via-ssh) :
- `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your@email.com"`
- →`ls ~/.ssh/`,
- →`clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`
- →then paste in github SSH keys

## clone a repository, then do more programming
1.Open ==git bash== in VS code
2.***Clone the git repository:***
	- `git clone https:xxx-repository-url`
